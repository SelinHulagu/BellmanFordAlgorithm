    "Bellman-Ford algorithm is an algorithm to find shortest paths between one node to all other nodes on a given graph. So that it is a similar algorithm, in terms of the objecttive, with Dijkstra algorithm which also handles finding the shortest paths between nodes. Unlike to Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford algorithm can work with negative edge weights. In addition, while Dijkstra is a greedy algorihm, Bellman-Ford is not a greedy algorithm where algorithm is iterated (number of nodes)-1 times. Bellman-Ford algorithm gurantees to find the shortest paths by updating the shortest distances (number of nodes)-1 times considering at most (number of nodes)-1 edges can found in one of the paths. But as a drawback, Bellman-Ford algorithm is not valid when negative cycles are found since in this case shortest path does't exist, and is computationally rich. Key steps of the algorithm can be summarized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization= Assign infinity distance to all nodes, except the source, which is assigned to be 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1= Relax each edge one by one, and repeat it |V|-1 times (|V|= number of nodes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2= Detect the negative cycles and nodes in negative cycles "
